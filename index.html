                <p><strong>2B (YoRHa No. 2, Type B)</strong></p>
                <p>A blade…with a quiet volition.
                    An all-purpose battle android deployed as a member of the automated infantry squad, YoRHa. She is equipped with a sword for close-quarters combat, and can attack from range using the “Pod” tactical support system. Members of YoRHa
                    forgo names and are referred to only by their codes. Though regulations forbid them from expressing emotions, each model has its own distinguishing personality, and 2B is comparatively cool, calm, and collected.</p>

                <p><strong>9S (YoRHa No. 9, Type S)</strong></p>
                <p>A soul…and an ephemeral kindness.
                    Though he has the ability to attack, this YoRHa android specializes in research missions and excels in collecting information, mainly by hacking. Within YoRHa, 9S is comparatively varied in his emotional expressions and has a kind
                    personality.</p>

                <p>
                    A vortex…of the past and hatred.
                    The Type A is a YoRHa prototype model that is no longer in use. She specializes in close-range attacks. She was operated on a trial basis in the process of developing official models such as 2B and 9S. Personality-wise, she has
                    little to say and always acts independently.</p>

                <p>The leader of the “Bunker,” a military base orbiting Earth. She is in charge of all YoRHa units. Her position demands her to be calm and collected at all times, but she seems to worry for the personal safety of 2B and 9S. She also
                    appears to have some kind of history with YoRHa prototype model A2.</p>

                    They are mainly in charge of analyzing intel, and relaying orders to the YoRHa units on the planet’s surface. They have fairly different personalities, with 6O, who’s in charge of 2B, being relatively bright and cheerful, whereas
                    21O, in charge of 9S, is always cool and composed.</p>

                <p>These support units are part of every YoRHa soldier’s standard equipment. They come installed with various weapons used for long-range combat, and can also aid their owners in traversal. They can display messages coming in from
                    Command, and they are also capable of exchanging information among themselves to devise strategies. 2B is followed by Pod 042, while 9S is accompanied by Pod 153.</p>

                <p>Adam’s younger twin.
                    Contrary to Adam, Eve is short-tempered and doesn’t like thinking too much. His brother means the world to him.</p>
